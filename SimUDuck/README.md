#SimUDuck

*This project represent the Strategy Pattern. Also the idea of the project is to simulate a duck behaviour like a game. The game can show a large variety of duch spacies swimming, making quacking sound and flying.*

OO Principles used in the project:

> Encapsulate what varies

> Favour composition over inheritance

> Program to interface, not implementation

Strategy Pattern definition:

> Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from client that use it.
